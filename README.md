> A collection of vegan / vegetarian / animal rights quotations which I might use in a book sometime

Perhaps in the back of our minds we already understand, without all the science I’ve discussed, that something terribly wrong is happening. Our sustenance now comes from misery. We know that if someone offers to show us a film on how our meat is produced, it will be a horror film. We perhaps know more than we care to admit, keeping it down in the dark places of our memory—disavowed. When we eat factory-farmed meat we live, literally, on tortured flesh. Increasingly, that tortured flesh is becoming our own.

**Jonathan Safran Foer**

As long as Man continues to be the ruthless destroyer of other living beings, he will never know health or peace. For as long as men massacre animals, they will kill each other. Indeed, he who sows the seed of murder and pain cannot reap joy and love.

**Pythagoras**

I choose not to make a graveyard of my body for the rotting corpses of dead animals.

**George Bernard Shaw**

Nothing will benefit human health and increase chances for survival of life on Earth as much as the evolution to a vegetarian diet.

**Albert Einstein**

Some people think the plant-based, whole-foods diet is extreme. Half a million people a year will have their chests opened up and a vein taken from their leg and sewn onto their coronary artery. Some people would call that extreme. 

**Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn**
